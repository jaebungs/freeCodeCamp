            React lets you define components as classes or functions. Components
            defined as classes currently provide more features which are
            described in detail on this page. To define a React component class,
            you need to extend React.Component:
            <code>class Welcome extends React.Component { render() { return
            Hello, {this.props.name}
              ; } }</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            The only method you must define in a React.Component subclass is
            called render(). All the other methods described on this page are
            optional.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strongly recommend against creating your own base component
            classes. In React components,
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html"
              >code reuse is primarily achieved through composition rather than
              inheritance.

          <h3>The Component Lifecycle</h3>
          <p>
            Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override
            to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this
            lifecycle diagram as a cheat sheet. In the list below, commonly used
            lifecycle methods are marked as bold. The rest of them exist for
            relatively rare use cases.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="constructor()">
        <header class="section-header">constructor()</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            <code>constructor(props)</code>
            <em
              >If you don’t initialize state and you don’t bind methods, you
              don’t need to implement a constructor for your React
              component.</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The constructor for a React component is called before it is
            mounted. When implementing the constructor for a React.Component
            subclass, you should call super(props) before any other statement.
            Otherwise, this.props will be undefined in the constructor, which
            can lead to bugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, in React constructors are only used for two purposes:
          </p>

          <p>
            - Initializing local state by assigning an object to this.state.
          </p>
          <p>- Binding event handler methods to an instance.</p>

          <p>
            You should not call setState() in the constructor(). Instead, if
            your component needs to use local state, assign the initial state to
            this.state directly in the constructor:
            <code
            >constructor(props) { super(props); 
              // Don't call this.setState() here! this.state = { counter: 0 }; 
              this.handleClick =this.handleClick.bind(this); 
            }</code
            >
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="componentDidMount()">
        <header class="section-header">componentDidMount()</header>
        <article>
          <p><code>componentDidMount()</code></p>
          <p>
            componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is
            mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM
            nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote
            endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.
          </p>
          <p>
            This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do
            that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
          </p>
          <p>
            You may call setState() immediately in componentDidMount(). It will
            trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser
            updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render()
            will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the
            intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often
            causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to
            assign the initial state in the constructor() instead. It can,
            however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you
            need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends
            on its size or position.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="componentDidUpdate()">
        <header class="section-header">componentDidUpdate()</header>
        <article>
          <p><code>componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)</code></p>
          <p>
            componentDidUpdate() is invoked immediately after updating occurs.
            This method is not called for the initial render.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component
            has been updated. This is also a good place to do network requests
            as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a
            network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed).
          </p>
          <p><code
            >componentDidUpdate(prevProps) { 
              // Typical usage (don't forget to compare props): 
              if (this.props.userID !== prevProps.userID) {
            this.fetchData(this.props.userID); 
          } 
        }</code
          ></p>
          <p>
            You may call setState() immediately in componentDidUpdate() but note
            that it must be wrapped in a condition like in the example above, or
            you’ll cause an infinite loop. It would also cause an extra
            re-rendering which, while not visible to the user, can affect the
            component performance. If you’re trying to “mirror” some state to a
            prop coming from above, consider using the prop directly instead.
            Read more about why copying props into state causes bugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your component implements the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() lifecycle
            (which is rare), the value it returns will be passed as a third
            “snapshot” parameter to componentDidUpdate(). Otherwise this
            parameter will be undefined.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="componentWillUnmount()">
        <header class="section-header">componentWillUnmount()</header>
        <article>
          <p><code>componentWillUnmount()</code></p>
          <p>
            componentWillUnmount() is invoked immediately before a component is
            unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this
            method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or
            cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in
            componentDidMount().
          </p>
          <p>
            You should not call setState() in componentWillUnmount() because the
            component will never be re-rendered. Once a component instance is
            unmounted, it will never be mounted again.
          </p>
          <h3>Rarely Used Lifecycle Methods</h3>
          <p>
            The methods in this section correspond to uncommon use cases.
            They’re handy once in a while, but most of your components probably
            don’t need any of them. You can see most of the methods below on
            this lifecycle diagram if you click the “Show less common
            lifecycles” checkbox at the top of it.

      <section class="main-section" id="shouldComponentUpdate()">
        <header class="section-header">shouldComponentUpdate()</header>
        <article>
            <p><code>shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)</code></p>
            <p>Use shouldComponentUpdate() to let React know if a component’s output is not affected by the current change in state or props. The default behavior is to re-render on every state change, and in the vast majority of cases you should rely on the default behavior.</p>
            <p>shouldComponentUpdate() is invoked before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to true. This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate() is used.</p>
            <p>This method only exists as a performance optimization. Do not rely on it to “prevent” a rendering, as this can lead to bugs. Consider using the built-in PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate() by hand. PureComponent performs a shallow comparison of props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a necessary update.</p>
            <p>If you are confident you want to write it by hand, you may compare this.props with nextProps and this.state with nextState and return false to tell React the update can be skipped. Note that returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.</p>
            <p>We do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify() in shouldComponentUpdate(). It is very inefficient and will harm performance.</p>
            <p>Currently, if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false, then UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(), render(), and componentDidUpdate() will not be invoked. In the future React may treat shouldComponentUpdate() as a hint rather than a strict directive, and returning false may still result in a re-rendering of the component.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="static_getDerivedStateFromProps()">
        <header class="section-header">static getDerivedStateFromProps()</header>
        <article>
            <p><code>static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)</code></p>
            <p>getDerivedStateFromProps is invoked right before calling the render method, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.</p>
            <p>This method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, it might be handy for implementing a &lt;Transition&gt; component that compares its previous and next children to decide which of them to animate in and out.</p>
            <p>Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. Make sure you’re familiar with simpler alternatives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use componentDidUpdate lifecycle instead.</li>
                <li>If you want to re-compute some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead.</li>
                <li>If you want to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This method doesn’t have access to the component instance. If you’d like, you can reuse some code between getDerivedStateFromProps() and the other class methods by extracting pure functions of the component props and state outside the class definition.</p>
            <p>Note that this method is fired on every render, regardless of the cause. This is in contrast to UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local setState.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()">
        <header class="section-header">getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</header>
        <article>
            <p><code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)</code></p>
            <p>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() is invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to e.g. the DOM. It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. Any value returned by this lifecycle will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate().</p>
            <p>This use case is not common, but it may occur in UIs like a chat thread that need to handle scroll position in a special way.</p>
            <p>This use case is not common, but it may occur in UIs like a chat thread that need to handle scroll position in a special way.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p><code>class ScrollingList extends React.Component {
                constructor(props) {
                  super(props);
                  this.listRef = React.createRef();
                }
              
                getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
                  // Are we adding new items to the list?
                  // Capture the scroll position so we can adjust scroll later.
                  if (prevProps.list.length &lt; this.props.list.length) {
                    const list = this.listRef.current;
                    return list.scrollHeight - list.scrollTop;
                  }
                  return null;
                }
              
                componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {
                  // If we have a snapshot value, we've just added new items.
                  // Adjust scroll so these new items don't push the old ones out of view.
                  // (snapshot here is the value returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate)
                  if (snapshot !== null) {
                    const list = this.listRef.current;
                    list.scrollTop = list.scrollHeight - snapshot;
                  }
                }
              
                render() {
                  return (
                    &lt;div ref={this.listRef}&gt;{/* ...contents... */}&lt;/div&gt;
                  );
                }
              }</code></p>
              <p>In the above examples, it is important to read the scrollHeight property in getSnapshotBeforeUpdate because there may be delays between “render” phase lifecycles (like render) and “commit” phase lifecycles (like getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate).</p>
